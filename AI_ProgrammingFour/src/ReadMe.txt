**To only run the program, start at step 3.  To compile and run, start at step 1**

**How to compile my code**

1. Open Terminal or the Command Prompt and navigate to the mainPackage within my project (\src\mainPackage )

2. To compile, type javac OutputWriter.java FileToLineArray.java Probabilities.java Learner.java Classifier.java Main.java


**How to run my code**

3. Make sure that smallCorpus.txt is saved in the src directory and formatted appropriately.  Also make sure that stopWords.txt is saved in that directory and formatted appropriately.  If you'd like to run the program on a file other than smallCorpus.txt, you can replace that string on line 23 of Main.java by the name of the other input file.


4. To run, navigate just outside of the mainPackage, into the src folder and type:
	
	java mainPackage/Main
